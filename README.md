# Amazon-Prime-Video-Interactive-Dashboard
In my project featuring Amazon Prime Videos, I present an interactive dashboard that offers a comprehensive overview of the movies and shows available on the platform. Through meticulous data analysis, the dashboard provides detailed information on genre distribution, user ratings, release dates, and viewer demographics. This interactive tool aims to give users valuable insights into Amazon Prime Videos' content, helping them make informed viewing choices and enhancing their overall streaming experience.
